# home-automation-configs/homeassistant

These are my [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) configs, minus ``secrets.yaml``.

I install HomeAssistant in a virtualenv, on Debian 9, managed by Puppet.

At any given time I'm usually running the latest official release, plus any [pull requests I've opened](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajantman+) that haven't been released yet. The exact code I'm running is in the [jantman-current branch of my fork](https://github.com/jantman/home-assistant/tree/jantman-current).
